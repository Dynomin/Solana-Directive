# User Adoption & Growth Strategy

This project has a first-mover advantage as there are currently no similar platforms in the market. This allows us to capture significant public attention and establish ourselves as the go-to resource for Solana project discovery.

# Here's how we plan to achieve user adoption and scale:

**Free Model:** All projects will be featured for free, increasing visibility and attracting a wider audience.


**Community Focus:** We prioritize giving back to the community. This includes:

1. NFT Collection (Future): We plan to launch an NFT collection featuring new projects seeking funding.

2. Profit Sharing (Future): A portion of profits generated from investment opportunities will be used for:

    a. Converting 10% of revenue in $BONK and then burn it.

    b. Distributing 15% back to the community through marketing promotions.

    c. As the project is still being built and new features are planned the remaining 75% will be used to develop the platform.

**Fast Project Listing:** We have a strict directive to ensure new projects are shared on the website within 24 hours of their launch. This promotes inclusivity and gives all projects a chance to be seen, regardless of size.

# Leveraging Solana's Unique Features (Future)
While the current iteration focuses on project discovery, we plan to integrate features that leverage Solana's unique capabilities:

1. NFT Collection: An NFT collection giving users access to find new projects to invest in the Solana Ecosystem.

2. Tokenized Incentives: We might launch our own token based after seeing this turn into a profitable business.

This project has the potential to be a valuable resource for both project creators and investors within the Solana ecosystem. By promoting transparency and fostering a supportive community, we believe this project can contribute significantly to the growth of both BONK and the Solana Ecosystem.

# Current Market Landscape
Currently, there is no existing platform that serves the specific purpose of showcasing all new Solana projects in a centralized location. This gap in the market presents a significant opportunity for this project to establish itself as a vital resource for the Solana community. As this has started as a personal project to keep track of the new projects in the Solana Ecosystem, making it public can reap much more opportunities.
